I2C address:
char sensor_address = 0x39;
Control Register (0h) : 
00000011 - on (0x03h)
00000000 - off (0x00h)

Interrupt Control Register (6h)

0h - interrupt off

REGISTER        ADDRESS        BITS        DESCRIPTION       
DATA0LOW        Ch            7:0            ADC channel 0 lower byte
DATA0HIGH       Dh            7:0            ADC channel 0 upper byte
DATA1LOW        Eh            7:0            ADC channel 1 lower byte
DATA1HIGH       Fh            7:0            ADC channel 1 upper byte
NOTE: The ReadWord protocol can be used to read byte-paired registers. For example, the DATA0LOW and DATA0HIGH registers (as well as
the DATA1LOW and DATA1HIGH registers) may be read together to obtain the 16-bit ADC value in a single transaction
